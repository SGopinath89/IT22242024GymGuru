            The <b>back squat</b> is one of the most effective and widely used exercises for building strength, particularly in the lower body. It primarily targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and lower back, making it a comprehensive lower body workout. The exercise involves placing a barbell across the upper back, usually resting on the traps, while standing with feet shoulder-width apart. From this position, the individual lowers their body by bending their knees and hips, essentially sitting back into a squat. The depth of the squat can vary depending on flexibility, mobility, and personal goals, but a common benchmark is to lower the thighs to parallel with the ground. After reaching the desired depth, the person then drives through their heels to return to the standing position.

            Back squats are highly effective for improving overall leg strength and power, as well as enhancing core stability. This is because, during the squat, the core muscles, including the abdominals and lower back, engage to maintain balance and protect the spine. As a compound exercise, the back squat recruits multiple muscle groups, making it a highly efficient workout for building strength and muscle mass in the lower body. In addition to increasing strength, back squats can improve functional movement patterns, such as bending, lifting, and walking, making them useful for daily activities and athletic performance.</p>
